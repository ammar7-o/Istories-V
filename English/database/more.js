                "Hello! My name is <span class='mark'>Lina</span>. I want to tell you about my <span class='mark'>family</span>. <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511988617509-a57c8a288659' alt='Family photo' width='300'> I have a wonderful family. We are five people in total. Let me introduce everyone to you.",
                "First, my <span class='mark'>father</span>. His name is <span class='mark'>David</span>. He is forty-five years old. He works as a <span class='mark'>teacher</span> at a school. He teaches mathematics. My father loves his job. He says teaching children is very rewarding. After work, he likes to read <span class='mark'>books</span> in the living room. He reads many different books - history books, science books, and sometimes novels.",
                "My <span class='mark'>mother</span> is named <span class='mark'>Sarah</span>. She is forty-two years old. She works in an <span class='mark'>office</span> in the city center. She works with computers. My mother is an excellent cook. She makes delicious food every day. Her <span class='mark'>pasta</span> is my favorite. On weekends, she bakes cakes and cookies. The whole house smells wonderful when she bakes.",
                "I have two <span class='mark'>sisters</span>. My older sister is <span class='mark'>Emma</span>. She is fifteen years old. She goes to high school. Emma loves <span class='mark'>animals</span>. We have a cat named <span class='mark'>Whiskers</span>. Emma takes care of Whiskers every day. She gives him food and plays with him. My younger sister is <span class='mark'>Sophie</span>. She is only six years old. She goes to primary school. Sophie likes to draw and color.",
                "Now, let me describe our <span class='mark'>home</span>. We live in a <span class='mark'>house</span> with a red door. The house has two floors. On the first floor, we have a living room, a kitchen, and a dining room. The living room is big. There is a comfortable sofa and two armchairs. We watch television there in the evening. <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1560448204-e02f11c3d0e2' alt='Living room' width='300'>",
                "The <span class='mark'>kitchen</span> is my mother's favorite room. It has modern appliances - a refrigerator, an oven, and a dishwasher. The dining room has a wooden table with six chairs. We eat all our meals there together.",
                "On the second floor, there are three <span class='mark'>bedrooms</span> and one bathroom. My parents have the biggest bedroom. Emma and I share a bedroom. Sophie has her own small bedroom. Our bedroom has two beds, two desks, and a bookshelf. We study at our desks in the evening.",
                "Our house has a <span class='mark'>garden</span> at the back. The garden is not very big, but it's beautiful. There are flowers of different colors - red roses, yellow daisies, and purple lavender. My father takes care of the garden. He waters the plants every evening. Sometimes we have <span class='mark'>picnics</span> in the garden on sunny days.",
                "We also have a small <span class='mark'>garage</span> where we keep our car. The car is blue. My father drives us to school every morning. In the afternoon, my mother picks us up.",
                "Every day follows a similar <span class='mark'>routine</span>. We wake up at seven o'clock. We have breakfast together at seven-thirty. Breakfast is usually cereal, milk, and fruit. Then we go to school and work. In the evening, we come home at about five o'clock. We do our homework, then we help with dinner preparation.",
                "Dinner time is special. We all sit at the dining table. We eat and talk about our day. We discuss what happened at school and work. We laugh and share stories. After dinner, we sometimes play board games or watch a movie.",
                "On <span class='mark'>weekends</span>, our routine is different. We sleep a little longer. We have a big breakfast together. Then we do different activities. Sometimes we visit my grandparents. Sometimes we go to the park or museum. Other times we just stay home and relax.",
                "My family has many <span class='mark'>traditions</span>. On birthdays, we have a special celebration. The birthday person chooses their favorite meal. We give presents and eat cake. On Christmas, we decorate the house with lights and a Christmas tree. We sing songs and exchange gifts.",
                "I feel very <span class='mark'>lucky</span> to have such a wonderful family. We love each other very much. We help each other when there are problems. We celebrate together when there are happy moments. Family is the most important thing in life.",
                "What about your family? Do you have brothers or sisters? What is your home like? Every family is different, but every family is special in its own way. The important thing is to appreciate and love your family members."

Today I will tell you about my typical <span class='mark'>school</span> day. <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523050854058-8df90110c9f1' alt='School building' width='300'> My name is Tom, and I am twelve years old. I study at Greenfield Middle School. It's a nice school with friendly teachers and students.",
                "My day starts early. The <span class='mark'>alarm clock</span> rings at 6:30 AM. I wake up and stretch. First, I go to the <span class='mark'>bathroom</span> to wash my face and brush my teeth. Then I get dressed in my school uniform. Our uniform is blue and white - a blue shirt, gray trousers, and black shoes.",
                "At 7:00 AM, I go downstairs for <span class='mark'>breakfast</span>. My mother prepares breakfast every morning. Today we have scrambled eggs, toast, and orange juice. I eat quickly because I don't want to be late for school. After breakfast, I brush my teeth again and pack my school bag.",
                "My school starts at 8:00 AM, but I need to leave home at 7:30 AM. I walk to school with my friend <span class='mark'>James</span>. James lives next door. We meet at 7:30 exactly. The walk to school takes about fifteen minutes. We talk about homework, games, and our plans for the weekend.",
                "When we arrive at school, we go directly to our <span class='mark'>classroom</span>. Our classroom is on the second floor, room 205. It's a bright room with big windows. There are twenty desks arranged in rows. Each desk has two chairs. I sit next to my friend Lisa.",
                "The first lesson starts at 8:00 AM sharp. Today, Monday, we have <span class='mark'>mathematics</span> first. Our math teacher is Mr. Johnson. He is tall and kind. He explains new concepts clearly. Today we learn about fractions. At first, it seems difficult, but Mr. Johnson gives us many examples.",
                "Mathematics lasts for 45 minutes. At 8:45 AM, we have a short <span class='mark'>break</span>. During the break, we go to the playground. Some students eat snacks. Others play games. I usually talk with my friends or drink water from the fountain.",
                "The second lesson is <span class='mark'>English</span>. Our English teacher is Mrs. Wilson. She speaks very clearly. Today we read a short story about a boy and his dog. After reading, we answer questions about the story. Then we learn new vocabulary words. Mrs. Wilson writes the words on the whiteboard.",
                "After English, we have <span class='mark'>science</span>. Science is my favorite subject. Today we learn about plants. Our teacher, Ms. Garcia, shows us pictures of different plants. She explains how plants make their own food through photosynthesis. We also look at real leaves under a microscope.",
                "At 10:30 AM, we have a longer break - 20 minutes. This is our <span class='mark'>snack time</span>. I eat the sandwich my mother prepared. It's ham and cheese today. I also have an apple. Some students buy food from the school canteen. The canteen sells sandwiches, fruit, and drinks.",
                "After the break, we have <span class='mark'>history</span>. History is interesting but sometimes difficult because there are many dates to remember. Today we learn about ancient Egypt. We see pictures of pyramids and pharaohs. Our teacher tells us about the Nile River and how important it was for Egyptian civilization.",
                "The last lesson before lunch is <span class='mark'>art</span>. I enjoy art class because we can be creative. Today we paint with watercolors. The teacher gives us the theme 'My Dream House'. I paint a house with a big garden and a swimming pool. My friend James paints a treehouse.",
                "Lunchtime is at 12:30 PM. We have one hour for lunch. Most students eat in the school <span class='mark'>cafeteria</span>. <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564759298141-cef86f51d4d4' alt='School cafeteria' width='300'> The cafeteria serves different meals every day. Today there's chicken with rice, vegetable soup, or pasta. I choose chicken with rice. I sit with my friends Lisa, James, and Sam.",
                "After lunch, we have <span class='mark'>physical education</span> (PE). We change into our sports clothes in the locker room. Today we play football in the school field. I'm not very good at football, but I try my best. Running and playing with friends is fun. PE class makes me feel energetic.",
                "The final lesson of the day is <span class='mark'>music</span>. In music class, we learn to play the recorder. Today we practice a simple song called 'Happy Melody'. Our music teacher, Mr. Lee, is very patient. He shows us how to place our fingers correctly. By the end of the lesson, most of us can play the song.",
                "School finishes at 3:00 PM. Our teacher gives us <span class='mark'>homework</span> for tomorrow. We have math exercises and English vocabulary to learn. I write the homework in my notebook carefully so I don't forget.",
                "After school, I participate in the chess club. The chess club meets every Monday and Wednesday. I'm learning to play chess better. Today I play against my friend Mia. She wins, but I learn from my mistakes. The chess club finishes at 4:00 PM.",
                "I walk home with James again. We talk about our day and the homework. When I arrive home at 4:30 PM, my mother asks about my day. I tell her about the fractions in math and the football game in PE.",
                "First, I have a small snack - cookies and milk. Then I start my homework. I do mathematics first because it's the most difficult. Then I do English. I finish all my homework by 5:30 PM.",
                "After homework, I have free time. Today I read a book about space. I'm interested in planets and stars. At 6:30 PM, my father comes home from work. We have dinner together at 7:00 PM. We have spaghetti with tomato sauce.",
                "After dinner, I help clear the table. Then I watch television with my family for one hour. We watch a nature documentary about oceans. At 8:30 PM, I take a shower and put on my pajamas.",
                "Before bed, I pack my school bag for tomorrow. I check that I have all my books and homework. I also prepare my school uniform. At 9:00 PM, I go to bed. I read for fifteen minutes, then turn off the light.",
                "This is my typical school day. It's busy but enjoyable. I learn many things, see my friends, and participate in activities. School helps me gain knowledge and develop skills. It also teaches me how to work with others and solve problems.",
                "Every school day is different, but the routine is similar. I like going to school because it prepares me for the future. What is your school day like? Do you have similar subjects and activities?"

My mother says I'm old enough to help with shopping. I feel excited and responsible.",
                "Before we leave home, my mother makes a <span class='mark'>shopping list</span>. She writes down all the things we need. She checks what we have in the refrigerator and cabinets. Then she adds items to the list. I help by suggesting what we might need.",
                "Our shopping list has several categories. First, <span class='mark'>fruits</span> and <span class='mark'>vegetables</span>. We need apples, bananas, carrots, and tomatoes. Second, <span class='mark'>dairy products</span>. We need milk, cheese, yogurt, and eggs. Third, <span class='mark'>meat</span> and <span class='mark'>fish</span>. We need chicken and salmon.",
                "We also need <span class='mark'>bread</span> and <span class='mark'>cereal</span>. And we need some <span class='mark'>cleaning supplies</span> - soap and laundry detergent. Finally, we need a few personal items - toothpaste and shampoo.",
                "My mother takes her <span class='mark'>purse</span> with money and credit cards. I take a reusable shopping bag. We believe in protecting the environment, so we don't use plastic bags. Our reusable bag is strong and can hold many items.",
                "We walk to the supermarket. It's not far from our house - only ten minutes on foot. The weather is nice today - sunny but not too hot. We pass by the park and see children playing. We also pass by a bakery that smells wonderful.",
                "We arrive at the supermarket called 'Fresh Mart'. It's a big store with automatic doors. When we enter, we take a shopping cart. The shopping cart has four wheels and a large basket. I push the cart while my mother holds the list.",
                "First, we go to the <span class='mark'>fruit and vegetable section</span>. This area is always colorful and fresh. There are piles of apples - red apples and green apples. We choose six red apples. They look shiny and delicious.",
                "Next to the apples, there are <span class='mark'>bananas</span>. We take a bunch of bananas. They are yellow with some green spots. My mother says they will ripen in a day or two. Then we go to the vegetables. We choose fresh carrots - they are orange and firm. We also take four tomatoes - they are red and round.",
                "We continue to the <span class='mark'>dairy section</span>. This section is cold. We need to be quick because it's chilly here. First, we take a bottle of milk. We choose semi-skimmed milk. Next, we choose a block of cheddar cheese. Then we take two containers of plain yogurt. Finally, we take a dozen eggs. I carry the eggs carefully so they don't break.",
                "Now we go to the <span class='mark'>meat and fish counter</span>. There's a man behind the counter wearing a white uniform. My mother asks for two chicken breasts. The man weighs them and puts them in a package. Then we go to the fish area. We choose two pieces of salmon. They look fresh and pink.",
                "Next is the <span class='mark'>bakery section</span>. The smell here is amazing - fresh bread and pastries. We take a loaf of whole wheat bread. We also take a packet of breakfast cereal. I like cereal with milk in the morning.",
                "We move to the <span class='mark'>household goods</span> aisle. Here we find soap, detergent, and other cleaning products. We choose a bar of soap and a bottle of laundry detergent. The detergent has a nice floral scent.",
                "Finally, we go to the <span class='mark'>personal care</span> aisle. We need toothpaste and shampoo. There are many brands to choose from. We choose our usual brands. I like mint toothpaste because it makes my mouth feel fresh.",
                "My mother checks the shopping list. 'I think we have everything,' she says. But then she remembers we need cooking oil. We go back to the cooking supplies aisle and get a bottle of olive oil.",
                "Now our shopping cart is full. We go to the <span class='mark'>checkout counters</span>. There are several counters, but some have long lines. We choose a counter with a shorter line. We wait patiently for our turn.",
                "When it's our turn, we put all our items on the conveyor belt. The <span class='mark'>cashier</span> is a friendly woman. She scans each item with a beeping sound. I help by putting scanned items into our reusable bag. Some items are heavy, so I put them at the bottom.",
                "The cashier tells us the total amount: 'That will be 68 dollars and 50 cents, please.' My mother pays with her credit card. She inserts the card into the machine and enters her PIN. The payment is successful.",
                "The cashier gives us a <span class='mark'>receipt</span>. My mother puts it in her purse. She always keeps receipts in case we need to return something. We take our bags and leave the supermarket.",
                "Carrying the bags home is a bit heavy. I carry the lighter bag with bread and cereal. My mother carries the heavier bag with milk and other items. We walk slowly because the bags are heavy.",
                "When we arrive home, we put all the items in their proper places. First, we put the perishable items in the <span class='mark'>refrigerator</span>. The milk, cheese, yogurt, eggs, chicken, and salmon go in the refrigerator. <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1588864725256-5312c0b8d5a9' alt='Refrigerator' width='300'>",
                "Next, we put the fruits and vegetables in the fruit bowl or vegetable drawer. The apples and bananas go in the fruit bowl on the kitchen counter. The carrots and tomatoes go in the refrigerator's vegetable drawer.",
                "The bread goes in the bread box. The cereal goes in the cabinet. The cooking oil goes next to the stove. The soap and shampoo go in the bathroom. The laundry detergent goes in the laundry room.",
                "After everything is put away, my mother makes us a snack. She cuts an apple and gives me a piece of cheese. We sit at the kitchen table and rest. Shopping makes us tired but also satisfied.",
                "I ask my mother about the shopping experience. 'Did we forget anything?' I ask. She checks the list again and says no, we bought everything. 'You were a great helper today,' she says. I feel proud.",
                "Shopping at the supermarket is an important life skill. It teaches me about planning, making choices, and managing money. I learn to compare prices and choose quality products. I also learn about different food groups and nutrition.",
                "My mother explains that we should buy what we need, not what we want. This helps us save money and avoid waste. We should also check expiration dates to ensure food is fresh.",
                "Next time we go shopping, I want to help even more. Maybe I can push the cart the whole time, or maybe I can calculate the total cost. Each shopping trip is a learning opportunity.",
                "Going to the supermarket might seem ordinary, but it's actually quite interesting. You see different people, different products, and you learn to make decisions. It's also good exercise because you walk and carry things.",
                "I enjoy spending this time with my mother. We talk while we shop, and she teaches me many things. She explains why we choose certain products over others. She shows me how to check if fruits and vegetables are fresh.",
                "Now I understand why my mother makes a shopping list. Without a list, we might forget important items. Or we might buy things we don't need. A list helps us stay organized and efficient.",
                "I also understand why we use reusable bags. Plastic bags are bad for the environment. They take hundreds of years to decompose. Reusable bags are stronger and can be used many times.",
                "Shopping is done for this week. Our refrigerator and cabinets are full. We have enough food for the next several days. I feel happy that I contributed to this important household task.",
                "Tomorrow is Sunday, and we will use some of these ingredients to cook a special family dinner. My mother plans to make roasted chicken with vegetables. I will help with the preparation. But that's a story for another day.",
                "For now, I'm content knowing that I helped my mother with shopping. It's a small responsibility, but it makes me feel grown-up. Every small task helps me learn and become more independent."

Today I want to tell you all about Max and what it's like to have a pet dog.",
                "We got Max when he was just a <span class='mark'>puppy</span>. He was eight weeks old and very small. I remember the first day he came home. He was nervous and cried a little. But soon he became comfortable in our house.",
                "Max is medium-sized now. He has beautiful golden fur that's soft and shiny. His eyes are brown and very expressive. When he looks at me, I can understand what he wants. His tail is long and fluffy. When he's happy, he wags his tail very fast.",
                "Taking care of a dog involves many <span class='mark'>responsibilities</span>. Every morning, my first job is to feed Max. He eats special dog food twice a day - in the morning and in the evening. I measure one cup of dry food and put it in his bowl. Sometimes I mix it with a little wet food as a treat.",
                "After eating, Max needs fresh water. I fill his water bowl with clean water. I change the water at least twice a day. Dogs need to drink plenty of water, especially after exercise or on hot days.",
                "Max also needs <span class='mark'>exercise</span>. Every day, we go for walks. In the morning, we take a short walk around the neighborhood. In the afternoon, we take a longer walk to the park. Max loves these walks. He gets excited when he sees his leash.",
                "At the park, Max can run freely in the designated dog area. He chases balls and plays with other dogs. His favorite game is fetch. I throw a tennis ball, and he runs to get it. He brings it back and drops it at my feet, waiting for me to throw it again.",
                "After our walk, I brush Max's fur. Brushing is important because it removes loose hair and keeps his coat healthy. I use a special dog brush. Max enjoys being brushed - he lies down and closes his eyes contentedly.",
                "Once a week, Max needs a <span class='mark'>bath</span>. Bath time is interesting. At first, Max doesn't want to get in the bathtub. I have to encourage him gently. I use special dog shampoo that doesn't irritate his skin. After the bath, I dry him with a big towel. Then he runs around the house, happy to be clean.",
                "Max has his own <span class='mark'>bed</span> in the corner of the living room. It's a comfortable padded bed. He sleeps there at night. Sometimes, when he's scared of thunder, he comes to my room. I let him sleep on a mat next to my bed.",
                "Dogs need regular visits to the <span class='mark'>veterinarian</span> (animal doctor). We take Max to the vet every six months for a check-up. The vet examines his teeth, ears, and overall health. Max also gets vaccinations to protect him from diseases. Once a month, I give Max a pill to prevent fleas and ticks.",
                "Training is another important aspect of having a dog. When Max was a puppy, we taught him basic commands. He knows 'sit', 'stay', 'come', and 'down'. We used treats as rewards. Now he obeys these commands most of the time. We're still working on 'heel' - walking nicely without pulling on the leash.",
                "Max has a <span class='mark'>personality</span>. He's very friendly and loves people. When visitors come to our house, Max greets them enthusiastically. He's also protective. If he hears strange noises at night, he barks to alert us.",
                "One of Max's funny habits is chasing his own tail. He spins in circles trying to catch it. It's hilarious to watch. He also loves to dig in the garden. We had to create a special sand area where he's allowed to dig.",
                "Max has favorite <span class='mark'>toys</span>. He has a squeaky toy that looks like a hamburger. He has a rubber bone for chewing. And he has a rope toy for tug-of-war games. I play with him every day to keep him mentally stimulated.",
                "Having a dog means cleaning up after him. I'm responsible for picking up Max's waste during walks. I use special bags for this purpose. It's not a pleasant task, but it's necessary for cleanliness and public health.",
                "Max has changed our family routine. We plan our days around his needs. We can't be away from home for too long because Max needs to go outside. When we go on vacation, we need to find someone to care for him, or take him to a kennel.",
                "But all these responsibilities are worth it because of the <span class='mark'>joy</span> Max brings. When I come home from school, Max is waiting at the door. He jumps up and down with excitement. No matter what kind of day I've had, seeing Max makes me happy.",
                "Max is also a good companion. When I'm sad, he comes and rests his head on my lap. He doesn't say anything, but his presence is comforting. Studies show that pets can reduce stress and make people happier.",
                "Having a dog teaches me about <span class='mark'>compassion</span> and <span class='mark'>responsibility</span>. I learn to care for another living being. I learn that Max depends on me for his needs. This makes me more responsible in other areas of life too.",
                "Max has also helped me make friends. When I walk him in the park, other dog owners talk to me. We share stories about our pets. I've met several neighbors because of Max.",
                "There are challenges too. Sometimes Max gets sick. Once he ate something he shouldn't have and had an upset stomach. We had to take him to the vet emergency. It was scary, but he recovered quickly.",
                "Another challenge is shedding. Golden retrievers shed a lot of hair. We have to vacuum the house frequently. My clothes often have dog hair on them. But we accept this as part of having a dog.",
                "Max has favorite foods besides his dog food. He loves carrots and apples as treats. He also likes peanut butter (without xylitol, which is dangerous for dogs). We give him these treats in moderation.",
                "In the summer, we need to protect Max from the heat. We walk him early in the morning or late in the evening when it's cooler. We make sure he always has access to shade and water. We never leave him in a hot car.",
                "In the winter, Max loves the cold weather. He plays in the snow and gets snowflakes on his fur. After playing in the snow, we need to wipe his paws to remove ice and salt.",
                "Max has a <span class='mark'>birthday</span> on June 15th. We celebrate with a special dog-friendly cake (made from peanut butter, pumpkin, and yogurt). We give him a new toy as a present. He doesn't understand it's his birthday, but he enjoys the attention and treats.",
                "I keep a photo album of Max. There are pictures of him as a tiny puppy, pictures of him learning commands, pictures of him sleeping in funny positions. Looking at these photos reminds me of how he's grown and changed.",
                "Some people think having a pet is too much work. It's true that it requires time, effort, and money. But the rewards are immense. The unconditional love a dog gives is priceless.",
                "Max has been with us for three years now. I can't imagine life without him. He's not just a pet; he's a member of our family. My parents say he's my 'furry brother'.",
                "If you're thinking about getting a dog, remember that it's a long-term commitment. Dogs can live ten to fifteen years. You need to be ready for this responsibility. Different dog breeds have different needs - some need more exercise, some need more grooming.",
                "I would recommend getting a dog from a shelter. Many wonderful dogs need homes. Our next dog will probably come from a shelter. But for now, we're happy with Max.",
                "Having Max has taught me many life lessons. I've learned about patience (when training him), about consistency (with routines), and about empathy (understanding his needs). These lessons will help me throughout my life.",
                "As I write this, Max is sleeping at my feet. He's dreaming - his legs are moving like he's running. Maybe he's dreaming about chasing squirrels in the park. I smile and continue writing, grateful for my furry friend."

Today, I want to describe what each season is like where I live.",
                "Let's start with <span class='mark'>spring</span>. Spring comes after winter, usually in March. The weather becomes warmer gradually. The snow melts, and the days get longer. Spring is a time of renewal and growth.",
                "In early spring, you can see the first signs of new life. <span class='mark'>Flowers</span> begin to bloom. Crocuses and daffodils appear in gardens. Trees that were bare during winter start growing new leaves. The leaves are small and bright green at first.",
                "The weather in spring is changeable. Some days are warm and sunny. Other days are cool and rainy. April showers are common. But the rain helps plants grow. After rain, everything looks fresh and clean.",
                "Animals become active in spring. Birds return from their winter migration. They build nests and lay eggs. You can hear birds singing early in the morning. Squirrels chase each other up and down trees.",
                "People enjoy outdoor activities in spring. They work in their gardens, planting flowers and vegetables. Children play outside more often. Families go for walks in parks to see the blossoms.",
                "Spring is also the time for cleaning. Many people do 'spring cleaning' - a thorough cleaning of their homes. They open windows to let in fresh air after the closed-up winter months.",
                "Next comes <span class='mark'>summer</span>. Summer is the warmest season. It starts in June and lasts until August. Days are long, and nights are short. The sun rises early and sets late.",
                "Summer weather is usually hot and dry. Sometimes there are thunderstorms with lightning and thunder. These storms can be dramatic but often don't last long. After a storm, the air feels cooler and fresher.",
                "During summer, plants are in full growth. Trees have thick green leaves. Flowers like roses and sunflowers are abundant. Grass grows quickly and needs regular mowing. Fruits and vegetables ripen - strawberries, tomatoes, corn.",
                "Summer is vacation time for students. Schools are closed for about two months. Families often go on trips - to the beach, to the mountains, or to visit relatives. Some children go to summer camps.",
                "Summer activities include swimming, picnics, and barbecues. People spend time at pools, lakes, or beaches. They wear light clothing - shorts, t-shirts, and sandals. Sunscreen is important to protect skin from sunburn.",
                "Evenings are pleasant in summer. People sit outside until late. They might have dinner on the patio or watch fireflies. Some neighborhoods have outdoor concerts or movies in the park.",
                "After summer comes <span class='mark'>autumn</span> (also called fall). Autumn begins in September. The weather becomes cooler gradually. Days get shorter, and nights get longer.",
                "The most noticeable feature of autumn is the changing <span class='mark'>colors</span> of leaves. <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506905925346-21bda4d32df4' alt='Autumn leaves' width='300'> Green leaves turn to beautiful shades of yellow, orange, and red. This happens because trees prepare for winter by stopping chlorophyll production.",
                "The weather in autumn is crisp and cool. Mornings might be foggy. Afternoons are often sunny and pleasant. Nights become chilly. People start wearing sweaters and light jackets.",
                "Autumn is harvest time. Farmers gather crops like apples, pumpkins, and corn. Many people go apple picking at orchards. They make apple pies and cider. Pumpkins are carved into jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween.",
                "Animals prepare for winter in autumn. Squirrels gather nuts and hide them for the cold months. Some birds migrate to warmer places. Bears eat a lot to build fat for hibernation.",
                "People's activities change in autumn. Children return to school after summer vacation. Sports like football are popular. Families go on drives to see the fall foliage in the countryside.",
                "Autumn has several holidays. In many countries, people celebrate Thanksgiving in autumn. They gather with family for a big meal. Halloween at the end of October is especially fun for children.",
                "Finally, there is <span class='mark'>winter</span>. Winter is the coldest season. It starts in December and lasts until February. Days are short, and nights are long. The sun sets early in the afternoon.",
                "Winter brings cold temperatures. In some places, it snows. Snow covers the ground like a white blanket. It transforms the landscape, making everything look clean and magical.",
                "When it's very cold, water freezes. Ponds and lakes might develop ice thick enough for skating. Icicles form on roof edges. Frost creates beautiful patterns on windows.",
                "Plants are dormant in winter. Most trees have lost their leaves and stand bare. Some plants, like evergreens, keep their leaves (needles) all year. They provide welcome green color in the winter landscape.",
                "Animals have different strategies for surviving winter. Some, like bears, hibernate. Others, like squirrels, live on stored food. Birds that don't migrate fluff their feathers for insulation.",
                "People adapt to winter in various ways. They wear warm clothing - coats, hats, gloves, scarves, and boots. Homes are heated to stay comfortable inside. Some people use fireplaces for extra warmth and ambiance.",
                "Winter activities include skiing, snowboarding, ice skating, and sledding. Children love building snowmen and having snowball fights. Hot chocolate is a popular drink after playing in the snow.",
                "Winter has important holidays. Christmas is celebrated in December. Many people decorate their homes with lights and Christmas trees. They exchange gifts and spend time with family. New Year's Eve marks the end of the year.",
                "Each season affects our daily lives. In spring and summer, we spend more time outdoors. In autumn and winter, we spend more time indoors. Our clothing changes with the seasons. Even the food we eat changes - lighter meals in warm weather, heartier meals in cold weather.",
                "The changing seasons remind us that nothing stays the same forever. After a long winter, spring brings hope. After hot summer, autumn brings relief. This cycle continues year after year.",
                "Some places don't have four distinct seasons. In tropical regions, it might be warm all year. In polar regions, it might be cold all year. I feel lucky to experience all four seasons where I live.",
                "Each season has its own beauty. Spring's new growth, summer's abundance, autumn's colors, winter's stillness - all are wonderful. I try to appreciate what each season offers.",
                "Seasonal changes also affect our mood. Many people feel more energetic in spring and summer. Some people feel melancholic in autumn or winter. Being aware of these effects can help us take care of our mental health.",
                "As the seasons change, I enjoy observing nature's transformations. I notice which birds arrive or leave. I watch flowers bloom and fade. I see trees go through their annual cycle. These observations connect me to the natural world.",
                "Climate change is affecting seasons. Winters are becoming milder in some places. Summers are becoming hotter. These changes have consequences for plants, animals, and people. We need to protect our environment.",
                "Despite modern technology that allows us to control our immediate environment (heating, air conditioning), we're still connected to natural cycles. We notice when days get longer or shorter. We respond to temperature changes.",
                "I keep a nature journal where I record seasonal observations. I note when I see the first robin in spring. I record the first snowfall in winter. Over years, these records show patterns and changes.",
                "The four seasons teach us about cycles - of life, of growth and rest, of change and continuity. Just as seasons change, our lives go through different phases. Each phase has its own challenges and beauties.",
                "As I finish writing, it's autumn where I live. The leaves are turning color. The air is cool and fresh. Soon winter will come, then spring, then summer. The cycle continues, reliable and comforting in its predictability.",
                "I encourage you to observe the seasons where you live. Notice the small changes. Appreciate what each season brings. Whether you have four distinct seasons or not, nature has rhythms worth observing and celebrating."
